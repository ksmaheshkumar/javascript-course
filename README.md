JavaScript Course
=================

This repository contains additional reading materials and exercises for the
course on computing models and functional programming I'm teaching.


## Approach

This course takes an approach similar to
[Teaching Programming with the Kernel Language Approach](http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/fdpefinalweb.pdf),
but focuses on a narrower range of concepts and attempts to be more
practical. The formalism and design focus is on equational reasoning and
design-by-correctness, as well as an approach to a type-driven development in
an untyped language (a dialect of JavaScript).
